# my-10-hours-snake-game
just a snake game, with all the steps (commits) it took to make it work (10 hours is the time it did take me to make it!).

I decided to take a couple of days free from Laravel to play with some python basics and decided to try to make the snake game, 
i have never been into games and the only time i spent on them was while reading the book Eloquent Javascript ch.16 A Platform Game.

-Added kyboard events functionality (snippet copied and pasted from https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.core.window.html)

-added a square representing the area where the snake is allowed to move

-added fixed square representing the initial snake

-added button to start the game

-added movement to snake
